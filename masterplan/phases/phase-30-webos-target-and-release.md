# Phase 30 — webOS Target & 1.0 Release

> **Epic goal:** The same app runs on an LG TV as a packaged webOS web app, the documentation set is complete, security and privacy are audited end to end, and version 1.0 is tagged, deployed, and released with all artifacts attached.
> **Verification:** `npm run package:webos` produces an `.ipk` that installs via `ares-install` and passes the full pointer-free remote journey on real webOS hardware; the security-audit report exists with zero unaccepted criticals; the `v1.0.0` tag, GitHub release with desktop + TV artifacts and `SHA256SUMS`, gh-pages deploy, and reconciled masterplan checkboxes all exist.

Before this phase ThunderTV ships on web and desktop (Phases 01–29) and the TV story is a design promise: keyboard-first UI (Phase 25), tiered storage with a real boot probe, `base: './'`, and the vendored-Spektrum swap all built for this moment. After this phase the swapped `dist/` runs as a packaged webOS app validated on real hardware — storage tier, remote navigation, MSE/hls.js playback, and TV performance all measured — the 1.0 documentation set and landing page are live, a final security and privacy audit is on record, and v1.0.0 is released the project's way: local builds, manual upload, no GitHub Actions anywhere.

## Feature 30.1 — webOS packaging

The web app becomes an LG TV app: a `webos/appinfo.json`, an ares-cli packaging chain over the swapped `dist/`, and an installable `.ipk` proven on emulator and real hardware.

- [ ] **30.1.1** Create `webos/appinfo.json` — id, three-part numeric version, vendor, `type: "web"`, `main: "index.html"`, title, icon references, and `resolution: "1920x1080"` per LG's required fields.
- [ ] **30.1.2** TV icon assets — the 80×80 icon and 130×130 large icon derived from the master icon via `scripts/gen-icons.mjs` into `webos/`.
- [ ] **30.1.3** Packaging chain — `npm run package:webos` runs `vite build` → `node scripts/package-target.mjs webos` → assemble a staging dir (`dist/` + `appinfo.json` + icons) → `ares-package` emitting the `.ipk` into `release/`.
- [ ] **30.1.4** ares-cli setup doc — `webos/README.md` covers installing the ares CLI tools, enabling TV Developer Mode, and `ares-setup-device` against the TV.
- [ ] **30.1.5** Install and launch — `ares-install --device tv` then `ares-launch`, confirmed first on the emulator, then on real hardware.
- [ ] **30.1.6** Remote debugging — `ares-inspect --device tv --app <id> --open` documented as the on-device devtools path; record the Chromium version each test TV reports.
- [ ] **30.1.7** Version-sync check — `package:webos` fails when the digits-only appinfo version has drifted from the `package.json` semver.
- [ ] **30.1.8** Artifact discipline — the `.ipk` follows the naming scheme (`thundertv-<version>-webos.ipk`) and joins `SHA256SUMS`.
- [ ] **30.1.9** Lifecycle behavior — verify relaunch/resume semantics (webOS keeps apps warm) and that `visibilitychange` pauses or continues playback sensibly; the chosen behavior noted as a decision.
- [ ] **30.1.10** Sideload doc — end-user Developer Mode install instructions, including the dev-mode expiry timer caveat, written for the Feature 30.7 docs set.

## Feature 30.2 — Import-map compatibility for TV

Older webOS Chromium predates import-map support (Chromium 89), so the TV package always uses the vendored Spektrum path and conditionally carries `es-module-shims` — injected only into the webOS build, never web or Electron.

- [ ] **30.2.1** Map the target engines — record webOS-version → Chromium-version for every available test device and emulator image, establishing which need the shim.
- [ ] **30.2.2** webOS swap strategy — `package-target.mjs webos` always rewrites to the vendored `./vendor/spektrum.min.js` (network-independent) and injects the shim script.
- [ ] **30.2.3** Vendor the shim — a pinned `es-module-shims` copy (~9 KB) in `public/vendor/`, referenced only by the webOS-swapped HTML.
- [ ] **30.2.4** Injection order — the shim `<script async>` placed before the import map per its documentation, verified working on an old-engine emulator image.
- [ ] **30.2.5** Runtime path telemetry — an inline `HTMLScriptElement.supports?.('importmap')` check records whether native or shim resolution activated, surfaced in the diagnostics export for TV bug reports.
- [ ] **30.2.6** Worker format check — verify the Vite worker chunks execute on old TV Chromium; switch the webOS build's workers to classic/iife format if module workers are missing, decision recorded.
- [ ] **30.2.7** Syntax floor — set the webOS build's `build.target` to the oldest measured TV Chromium so no modern-syntax parse error can crash boot; web and Electron keep the evergreen target.
- [ ] **30.2.8** CSS floor spot-check — verify the used CSS features (custom properties, `content-visibility`, flex gap) on the TV engine and add fallbacks only where actually broken.
- [ ] **30.2.9** Emulator matrix — run the swapped build on the oldest and newest available webOS emulator images and record pass/fail per feature.
- [ ] **30.2.10** Cross-target regression guard — the swap-verification specs assert the webOS HTML contains shim + vendored map while the Electron output has neither shim nor CDN and the web build keeps the pinned CDN.

## Feature 30.3 — TV storage probe validation

The tiered-storage design was built for exactly this hardware: validate that the boot probe classifies real webOS correctly, that partial/none degradation is livable and clearly messaged, and that TV quotas and eviction behave as designed.

- [ ] **30.3.1** On-device probe run — boot on real webOS, read the probed tier from the diagnostics surface, and record it per device and firmware in this phase file.
- [ ] **30.3.2** Probe timeout — add a bounded timeout to `probeIndexedDb` so a TV engine whose `open()` hangs demotes to the next tier instead of stalling boot; regression spec included.
- [ ] **30.3.3** Partial-tier journey — force the localStorage tier on the TV: sources re-fetch on boot with visible progress while favorites render instantly from denormalized snapshots; the one-line notice verified readable at 10-foot distance.
- [ ] **30.3.4** None-tier journey — force both probes to fail: a fully functional in-memory session with the storage notice, and a connect-URL re-import working every boot as the tier-none TV story.
- [ ] **30.3.5** Quota reality check — fill-test IDB and localStorage on device to measure actual TV quotas, and confirm `guardedSet` demotes gracefully at the real limits instead of crashing.
- [ ] **30.3.6** Standby persistence — verify stored data survives TV standby and full power-off cycles; measure whether webOS ever evicts app storage and document the finding.
- [ ] **30.3.7** Eviction recovery — if eviction occurs, the next boot must re-probe, re-parse sources, and explain once — not nag; verified by clearing app data manually.
- [ ] **30.3.8** Snapshot budget audit — confirm the capped favorites and recent snapshots (recent ≤ 100) fit comfortably within the measured TV localStorage budget on the partial tier.
- [ ] **30.3.9** Probe reasons in diagnostics — tier plus redacted probe-failure reasons included in the diagnostics export so TV reports are actionable.
- [ ] **30.3.10** User-facing doc — a "storage on TVs" subsection in the troubleshooting guide summarizing per-tier behavior in plain words.

## Feature 30.4 — Remote navigation validation

The Phase 25 keyboard-first UI is the remote-control story; this feature proves it on the couch — the complete journey from provisioning through browsing, playback, and settings without a pointer ever appearing.

- [ ] **30.4.1** Key-code mapping — map webOS remote codes (OK, arrows, Back = 461, media keys) onto the Phase 25 keyboard map in a small `src/ui/input/webos-keys.ts`, only where codes differ from desktop.
- [ ] **30.4.2** Back-button semantics — define and implement the Back stack order (close panel → exit theater → stop dock → platform back), aligned with LG guidelines; decision noted.
- [ ] **30.4.3** Journey script — document the full pointer-free run: cold boot → provision a source → arrow-browse → OK plays → dock/theater toggle → settings panel → favorite a channel.
- [ ] **30.4.4** Connect provisioning on TV — validate both paths: the TV-browser web app opened with a connect bookmark fragment, and the packaged app's manual connect-link entry, confirming scrub and `save=0` semantics on both.
- [ ] **30.4.5** Focus visibility at 3 m — the roving-focus ring must be clearly visible on a 1080p panel from the couch; adjust the `tokens.css` focus token if washed out, with instant (non-animated) moves.
- [ ] **30.4.6** Focus-trap sweep — arrow-only navigation through every view (settings panel, group filter, EPG inline detail, player dock) hunting unreachable or looping focus; fix all traps.
- [ ] **30.4.7** Long-list navigation — held-arrow repeat over the 90 k list stays smooth under the windowing controller, and channel-up/down remote keys map to page jumps.
- [ ] **30.4.8** Player-mode keys — during playback: ←/→ zaps, media play/pause works, Back exits theater, and no key event leaks through to scroll the underlying list.
- [ ] **30.4.9** IME interplay — the webOS on-screen keyboard feeding search and connect entry works with the `data-model` bindings, including committed vs composing text.
- [ ] **30.4.10** Journey sign-off — record the full journey result per device; blockers fixed, cosmetics noted; a green re-run is this feature's exit criterion.

## Feature 30.5 — MSE/hls.js validation on device

TV media stacks are where streams that worked everywhere else go to die: the Phase 11 stream matrix re-runs on real webOS hardware, engine choices get TV-specific tuning, and every finding lands in the docs.

- [ ] **30.5.1** Port the matrix — the Phase 11 stream matrix (live/VOD HLS, TS vs fMP4 segments, H.264/AAC/AC-3, raw `.ts`, plain MP4) tabulated in `docs/qa-webos.md` for device runs.
- [ ] **30.5.2** MSE capability survey — record `MediaSource.isTypeSupported` results for the matrix codecs per TV and firmware as reference data.
- [ ] **30.5.3** hls.js on TV — run the HLS set through hls.js on device and tune conservative TV overrides (worker use, buffer lengths for TV memory) confined to the player config module.
- [ ] **30.5.4** Native-HLS decision — measure whether webOS native video handles HLS well enough to beat hls.js there; encode the per-target choice in `selectEngine` with the decision noted.
- [ ] **30.5.5** mpegts.js on TV — validate raw `.ts` live streams and measure CPU headroom; wire the stall-detection messaging for devices that cannot sustain it.
- [ ] **30.5.6** AC-3/E-AC-3 audio — validate the common IPTV audio codecs per device and document the support table, a top real-world TV complaint.
- [ ] **30.5.7** Recovery on device — exercise hls.js media-error recovery and network retry (Phases 11/23) by killing the mock stream mid-play on the TV.
- [ ] **30.5.8** Zap soak — zap 20 channels on device while watching memory via `ares-inspect`, confirming the destroy-before-create invariant (§5.3) holds and recording zap latency for Feature 30.6.
- [ ] **30.5.9** Mixed-content contrast — confirm the packaged app plays `http://` streams while the TV-browser web variant shows the mixed-content explanation, proving capability messaging is right on both paths.
- [ ] **30.5.10** Findings doc — complete the matrix with pass/fail/notes per device and firmware, and fold the conclusions into the troubleshooting guide.

## Feature 30.6 — TV performance pass

The Phase 26 measurement machinery goes to the living room: boot, import, scroll, zap, and search measured on real TV silicon at 1080p, judged against the throttled budget class and logged for posterity.

- [ ] **30.6.1** Boot spans on TV — read the Phase 26 `performance.mark` spans via `ares-inspect` for cold and warm starts with the cached fixture, compared against the throttled budgets.
- [ ] **30.6.2** Import on TV — 100 k fixture import wall-clock on device, recorded against the 5 s desktop budget with a TV-accepted number added under `budgets.json`'s throttled/TV key.
- [ ] **30.6.3** Scroll protocol on device — the 26.5 run driven by held remote arrows, with long tasks and the ≤ ~40 DOM-row cap verified through remote devtools.
- [ ] **30.6.4** Zap latency — key-press→first-frame across 10 zaps per engine; p50/p95 recorded and a TV target set (with the number noted as a decision).
- [ ] **30.6.5** Search on TV — on-device p95 keystroke latency including IME entry, confirming the 150 ms debounce absorbs IME jank.
- [ ] **30.6.6** Playback soak — a one-hour playback session watching heap and process memory (webOS kills hungry apps); no growth trend allowed, observed ceiling documented.
- [ ] **30.6.7** 1080p canvas check — verify layout and density defaults read well at 1920×1080 from 3 m, and that `devicePixelRatio` handling doesn't inflate DOM work.
- [ ] **30.6.8** Repaint sanity — paint-flashing via remote devtools confirms the 30 s tick repaints only rows whose now/next actually changed, on TV as on desktop.
- [ ] **30.6.9** Perf-log entries — every TV number lands in `masterplan/perf-log.md` tagged with device model and firmware version.
- [ ] **30.6.10** Budget verdict — an explicit pass/fail table against each §3 budget with TV-adjusted targets; failures triaged into fix-now vs documented limitation.

## Feature 30.7 — 1.0 documentation set

Everything a user or contributor needs, finished and verified: complete README, an illustrated user guide, the connect-URL guide with its honest security wording, and troubleshooting that covers the web's real limits.

- [ ] **30.7.1** README final pass — complete top to bottom: what it is, screenshots, web quickstart, desktop install, TV sideload, development, verify/test, deploy — every command re-run verbatim.
- [ ] **30.7.2** User guide — `docs/guide.md` covering import flows (file/paste/URL/Xtream), favorites and recent, EPG usage, search, the keyboard map, and a settings reference, with current dark-theme screenshots.
- [ ] **30.7.3** Connect-URL guide — `docs/connect-urls.md`: the fragment format, the per-source link generator, `save=0`, and the §7 security posture in plain words (fragment-only, scrubbed address bar, bookmark-sync tradeoff).
- [ ] **30.7.4** Troubleshooting — `docs/troubleshooting.md`: CORS on the web (why URL imports fail, the alternatives, the proxy setting), mixed content, TV storage tiers, unsigned installs, per-engine playback failures, and the diagnostics export.
- [ ] **30.7.5** Screenshot pipeline — `scripts/screenshots.mjs` produces consistent fixture-based screenshots via Playwright, so no real provider data or credentials can ever appear in docs.
- [ ] **30.7.6** Keyboard/remote reference — one canonical keys-to-remote-buttons table, with a doc-drift spec asserting it matches the Phase 25 keymap module.
- [ ] **30.7.7** FAQ — short honest answers: no telemetry, no bundled content or playlists (player only), why unsigned, why no auto-update, webOS dev-mode expiry.
- [ ] **30.7.8** Link integrity — README ↔ guide ↔ troubleshooting ↔ `PRIVACY.md` ↔ landing page cross-links verified by a link-check script pass.
- [ ] **30.7.9** Strings alignment — user-facing wording in docs matched against the central strings module (error names, notice texts) so guidance mirrors the actual UI.
- [ ] **30.7.10** Rendered review — a full read-through of every doc as rendered on GitHub and Pages, formatting fixed, completion noted in this phase file.

## Feature 30.8 — Landing page on Pages

A minimal hand-written static page — no build framework, no JS-heavy anything — that says what ThunderTV is, launches the web app, links the desktop downloads, and points TVs at their instructions.

- [ ] **30.8.1** Placement decision — the app keeps the Pages root (connect URLs unchanged); the landing ships from `public/welcome/` as `/welcome/`, with the decision and rationale noted.
- [ ] **30.8.2** Hand-written page — one `index.html` and one CSS file under `public/welcome/`, system font stack, dark theme with copied token values, no build step, no framework, and — like the app — no CSS transitions or animations.
- [ ] **30.8.3** Content — what it is in three sentences, a launch button into the web app, per-OS download links, a TV-instructions link, and the GitHub link.
- [ ] **30.8.4** Evergreen download links — point at the GitHub releases latest page rather than versioned asset URLs so the landing never goes stale between releases.
- [ ] **30.8.5** Hero screenshot — one optimized image from the Feature 30.7 pipeline (≤ ~100 KB) with explicit width/height so nothing shifts on load.
- [ ] **30.8.6** App → landing link — the app's About/footer links to `/welcome/` with a relative URL that works on the Pages subpath.
- [ ] **30.8.7** Weight budget — the whole landing including the image transfers in ≤ ~150 KB, verified with a devtools pass; performance is the brand even here.
- [ ] **30.8.8** Meta basics — title, description, and og tags, favicon reused from the icon set, and zero analytics with the posture restated in an HTML comment.
- [ ] **30.8.9** Accessibility pass — semantic landmarks, alt text, and a contrast check on the dark palette.
- [ ] **30.8.10** Deploy check — `npm run deploy` publishes the landing with the app; verify the live URL renders, all links resolve, and any connect-URL example on the page carries only `example.invalid` credentials.

## Feature 30.9 — Final security and privacy audit

Before 1.0, the credential path is traced end to end — fragment → scrub → storage → logs → export — the no-telemetry claim is verified against every network call site, and the dependency surface is audited and recorded.

- [ ] **30.9.1** Entry trace — audit every credential entry point (connect fragment, settings forms, Xtream import) confirming nothing ever writes credentials into a query string or visible URL.
- [ ] **30.9.2** Scrub trace — prove `history.replaceState` scrubs before any subsequent network request, using the mock server's request-order log, on web, `file://`, and TV.
- [ ] **30.9.3** Storage trace — inspect at-rest shapes on every tier: credentials only inside the sources store, and `save=0` keeping them memory-only for the session, verified via devtools storage inspection.
- [ ] **30.9.4** Log trace — a hostile-fixture spec sweep proving the redactor masks Xtream path-embedded credentials (§6.8), connect fragments, and auth-style headers at every logger entry point.
- [ ] **30.9.5** Export trace — the diagnostics export re-audited after the TV additions: the default export carries zero URLs and usernames, opt-in fields clearly labeled.
- [ ] **30.9.6** No-telemetry sweep — enumerate every network call site (tractable because the lint fences confine them to `src/core/http` and the Electron main HTTP), confirm each is user-initiated, and publish the inventory in `PRIVACY.md`.
- [ ] **30.9.7** Dependency audit — `npm audit` plus a manual review of the tiny production dependency set, and the vendored `spektrum.min.js` / `es-module-shims` hashes re-verified against their upstream releases.
- [ ] **30.9.8** Electron surface re-check — re-run the Phase 28.8 security checklist against the actual packaged 1.0 candidate artifact, not the source tree.
- [ ] **30.9.9** Supply-chain notes — lockfile committed, `npm ci` documented as the canonical install, and the dependency tree confirmed free of postinstall scripts (exceptions noted).
- [ ] **30.9.10** Audit report — findings and resolutions written to `docs/security-audit-1.0.md`; every open item fixed or explicitly accepted with rationale — the release blocks on unaccepted criticals.

## Feature 30.10 — Version 1.0 release

The final loop of the masterplan's way of working, executed for real: verify green, budgets reconciled, checkboxes true, tag pushed, web deployed, artifacts attached — all from a local machine, no Actions anywhere.

- [ ] **30.10.1** Preflight — full `npm run verify` plus web and Electron E2E green on the release commit; the `verify-report.json` archived alongside the release notes.
- [ ] **30.10.2** Budget reconciliation — `check-budgets` (bundles and artifacts) green and fresh `masterplan/perf-log.md` entries present for 1.0; the §3 budgets confirmed one final time.
- [ ] **30.10.3** Masterplan reconciliation — sweep all 30 phase files: every checkbox accurate, decision notes in place, stale claims corrected — the masterplan itself ships true.
- [ ] **30.10.4** Changelog 1.0 — collapse Unreleased into a curated `1.0.0` section: headline features and known limitations (web CORS, unsigned builds, webOS dev-mode installs).
- [ ] **30.10.5** Bump and tag — `scripts/release.mjs` bumps to 1.0.0, tags `v1.0.0` on the verified commit, and pushes `main` plus the tag.
- [ ] **30.10.6** Build all artifacts — Windows portable + NSIS, macOS DMG, Linux AppImage, and the webOS `.ipk`, all from the tag, with `SHA256SUMS` regenerated over the full set.
- [ ] **30.10.7** GitHub release — create `v1.0.0` manually (`gh release create` or the web UI), attach artifacts and checksums, paste the changelog; no CI touches any of it.
- [ ] **30.10.8** Deploy the web — `npm run deploy` publishes the 1.0 app and landing to gh-pages, followed by a live smoke on the Pages URL: import, play, connect URL, session restore.
- [ ] **30.10.9** Post-release QA — download and install each artifact from the release page (not local builds), run a quick Feature 29.8 pass per OS, and sideload the released `.ipk` on the TV.
- [ ] **30.10.10** Close the loop — point README badges and links at v1.0.0, mark the masterplan complete, and append a short retrospective with the post-1.0 backlog to the masterplan.
